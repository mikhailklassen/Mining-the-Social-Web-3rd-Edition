    "## Artificial Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by the biological neural networks that exist in the nervous systems of many organisms. Neural networks are understood as an information processing system with inputs and outputs. An artificial neural network consists of \"layers\" of \"neurons\". Each neuron is defined by an \"activation function\" that takes multiple inputs, each weighted by some value, and maps them to an output, usually a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs from one layer become the inputs for the next layer. A neural network will have an input layer, where each neuron in the input layer corresponds to a single feature of interest. These could be the pixel values in an image, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output layer often consists of neurons with each representing a class. You could create a network with 2 output neurons and the purpose of the network might be to determine whether a photo contains the image of a cat or not. This is a binary classifier. Or, you could have many output neurons, with each output neuron representing a different object that could be present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most neural networks also contain one or more \"hidden layers\" between the input and output layers. The presence of these make the internal workings of the network more opaque to our understanding, but they are vital for detecting complex nonlinear structures that could be present in the input patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network must be \"trained\" in order for it to have any reasonable degree of accuracy. Training is the process by which the network is shown inputs and the predicted output is compared to some ground truth output. The difference between predicted output and true output represents an error (also called the \"loss\") to be minimized. Using an algorithm called \"backpropagation\", these errors are used to update the weights on the inputs for each neuron throughout the network. Through successive iterations, the network can reduce its overall error and improve its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot more nuance to it than is covered here, but there are many good resources online and at O'Reilly Media if you want to go further."
